Thanks to:

	Luiz Roberto Meier for the postfix code which is the inside
	engine for the expression evaluation code. i

	I have to thank the LORD for the time and talent that lets me 
	create this software. I am grateful for the blessing in my life
	including my passion as a toolsmith. It is my hope that these
	programs are helpful to others in their function and as examples
	of systems programming, which has been my lifelong occupation.
	And also Handsome the cat, who sits with me patiently as I 
	endlessly message the keyboard. And Tina the staffy, whose
	boundless energy and joy are inspiring. And of course my family
	whose support warms my heart. 

	And also the the many people in the open source community whose
	respect I strive to earn as I make my own contributions to the
	amazing body of software and informaton now at our fingertips.
 
	And finally. Apple Computers, who have given me such an enjoyable
	alternative to the vision of Bill Gates and the monolith called 
	Microsoft.
